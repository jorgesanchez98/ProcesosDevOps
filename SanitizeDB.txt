Alright, sounds good. Just make certain the DB is sanitized for any databases restored to Test, QA, or Dev environments. Just in case no one has reviewed that with you yet, sanitizing the database usually means deleting the outgoing and incoming mail servers, disabling all scheduled actions, setting all shipping methods to Test mode, deleting all Online Bank Synchronizations, and disabling any connectors they have (ex: Avatax, TaxCloud, Shopify, etc) in the database on the non-production environment.
